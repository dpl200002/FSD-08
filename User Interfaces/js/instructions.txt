1. Store the current year in a variable.
2. Store the users birth year in a variable.
3. Calculate and save their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
4. Output to the console the users age

/* CLASS 02

Using your previously created file we are going to implement functions to make our code reusables
Create a function that will take a user's birth year as the only parameter.
This function should validate that the provided birth year is a javscript number 


----
Prompt users to provide you with a year of birth.
If they fail to provide a year ignore their request and do nothing else.
If they provide anything other then a year that is less then or equal the current year, alert them with an error message and Prompt them again
If their input pass validation, alert the user with their possible ages.

--- array.js ---
/*

Write a  function which accept a string as input 
Swap the case of each character
Output the result to the console

swapCase("Orange Ninja Cats"); // "oRANGE nINJA cATS"

Hint 1: Create two arrays that contain each letter of the alphabet
Hint 2: Find the index of the letter you are looking for (conditional statement)

*/



--- colors.js ---
// Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors 
// Colors should be red, blue, yellow, orange, purple 
// Access the first color in the array and print it to the console
// Access the third color in the array and print it to the console
// Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "green".
// Create a new variable called fourth Color and set it equal to the fourth color in the list and print it to the console.
// Add the color pink to the end of the list.
// Add the color white to the beginning of the list.
// Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()
// Remove the last color from the end of list and print it to the console.
// Output every color's value and every color's index in this format:  3, purple or 0, blue etc.


--- convert.js ---

/*
PART 1
convert C to F 
Store a Celsius temperature into a variable.
Save the converted Fahrenheit temperature in a variable
C to F = Multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32
Output to the console.	 X   C is    Y   F.

Store a Fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Save the converted Celsius temperature in a variable
F to C = Subtract 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
Output to the console.	 X   F is    Y   C.

Store a weight value in pounds
Save the converted kilogram weight in a variable
KG = LBS / 2.2046
Output to the console.	X   lbs is  Y   kg.

Store a weight value in kilograms
Save the converted pounds weight in a variable
LBS = KG / 0.454
Output to the console.	X   kg is  Y   lbs.


PART 2
Create functions for the 4 different calculation we have in our file
	convertC2F(x)
	convertF2C(x)
	convertLbs2Kg()
	convertKg2Lbs()
Using the built-in Number methods, toFixed the output so that the does not exceed 2 decimals spaces
	2 decimal for the KG
	1 decimal for the temperatures
	0 decimal for the LBS
